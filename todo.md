# Grid movement <- complete for now!

# Turns
    1. Player turns
        a. Check if can perform action (done)
        b. Perform action (done) (more to do on specific actions)
        c. end turn (manually right now, needs to be automatic when all units are out of actions);
    2. Enemy turns <- requires enemies!

# Enemies


# Abilties
    1. System scaffolding complete
        a. Ability id + registry
        b. To add an abillity you give it an ID and then write the execute logic for that ability
    
    2. Todo
        a. Add lots and lots of abilities.
        b. Figure out how to handle abilities that affect other abilities. (i.e: free grenade throw, next shot ignores cover ...etc);
        c. area of affect abilities.
        d. target unit abilities.
        e. target environment abilities.

Nice to haves:
1. Make diagonal movement take longer than perpendicular?
2. Show line preview when hovering over last waypoint tile rather than only other tiles in range from last waypoint.
